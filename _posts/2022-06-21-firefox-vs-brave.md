title: Firefox vs Brave
category: Browsers
---

I've been using [Google Chrome](//google.com/chrome) for the longest until I gave [Firefox](//https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) another try around last year. I was shocked to find how much it had changed. Even for developing I almost prefer it's tools to Chrome's.

It was also around the same time when I found out that Firefox is actually the default browser that ships with most Linux Distros.

I've also heard a lot of good things about [Brave](//brave.com), although I am not that familiar with it.

The goal of this research is to find the features, benefits, and drawbacks of these two browsers.
