I"ß<p>Welcome to Project Proper!</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to research different things to find the most private and secure way to use technology. You can find a more detailed list of goals in the <a href="http://localhost:4000/goals">goals</a> page.</p>

<p>I try my best to cite sources and quotes.</p>

<p>These pages are written Markdown and parsed with Jekyll to create a UI that is easy to navigate.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s only one javascript file that runs on these pages. Itâ€™s a <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/script.js">simple script</a> I wrote that enables dark/light mode, font changer (serif, sans-serif, monospaced), and changeable content widths. They use sessionStorage so they reset after every visit, learn more by reading <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">Web Storage API</a>.</p>

<p>If you chose to disable javascript in your browser the pages will still work properly. The script only serves to improve readability.</p>
