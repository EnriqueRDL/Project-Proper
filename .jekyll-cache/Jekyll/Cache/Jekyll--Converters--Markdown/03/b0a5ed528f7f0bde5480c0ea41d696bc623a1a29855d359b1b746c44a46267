I"*<p>I’ve been using <a href="//google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> for the longest until I gave <a href="//https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> another try around last year. I was shocked to find how much it had changed. Even for developing I almost prefer it’s tools to Chrome’s.</p>

<p>It was also around the same time when I found out that Firefox is actually the default browser that ships with most Linux Distros.</p>

<p>I’ve also heard a lot of good things about <a href="//brave.com">Brave</a>, although I am not jjjj</p>
