I"Â<p>Iâ€™ve been using <a href="//google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> for the longest until I gave Firefox another try around last year. I was shocked to find how much it had changed. Even for developing I almost prefer itâ€™s tools to Chromeâ€™s.</p>

<p>It was also around the same time when I found out that Firefox is actually the default browser that ships with most Linux Distros.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also heard a lot of good things about Brave.</p>
