Welcome to Project Proper!

The goal of this project is to research different things to find the most private and secure way to use technology. You can find a more detailed list of goals in the [goals]({{ site.url }}/goals) page.

I try my best to cite sources and quotes.

These pages are written Markdown and parsed with Jekyll to create a UI that is easy to navigate.

There's only one javascript file that runs on these pages. It's a [simple script]({{ site.url }}/assets/js/script.js) I wrote that enables dark/light mode, font changer (serif, sans-serif, monospaced), and changeable content widths. The script uses localStorage so your browser save the data, learn more by reading [Web Storage API](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).

If you chose to disable javascript in your browser the pages will still work properly. The script only serves to improve readability.
